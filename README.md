# Churn modelling with logistic regression and ANN

Churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customer cancellations 
within a time period by the number of active customers at the start of that period.

This dataset contains details of a bank's customers, 
with one column being a binary variable reflecting if the customer left the bank (closed his account).

This churn modelling classification task aims to predict if a customer of the bank has decided to terminate his or her bank membership.
I applied logistic regression and artificial neural networks for this binary classification problem. 
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling">Kaggle</a>.
