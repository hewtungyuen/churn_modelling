# Churn modelling with logistic regression and ANN

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. 

This dataset contains details of a bank's customers, 
with one column being a binary variable reflecting if the customer left the bank (closed his account).

We aim to predict if a customer of the bank decides to terminate his or her bank membership or not,
by using logistic regression and artificial neural networks. 

The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling">Kaggle</a>.
