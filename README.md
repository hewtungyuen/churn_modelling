# Churn modelling with logistic regression and ANN

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. 

This dataset contains details of a bank's customers, 
with one column being a binary variable reflecting if the customer left the bank (closed his account).

This churn modelling classification task aims to predict if a customer of the bank has decided to terminate his or her bank membership.
I applied logistic regression and artificial neural networks for this binary classification problem. 
The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling">Kaggle</a>.
